Tasks:
Finding Specific Loss Value:

Objective: Automatically find the value of losses for a specific policy.
Details: Use the "vlookup" formula, or any other method, to find the value of losses for:
Policy Number: "A20458"
Line of Business: "3341"
Inception Date: "15/03/2006"
Table of Total Premiums and Losses by Line of Business:

Objective: Summarize premiums and losses by line of business.
Details: Use the "SUMIFS" formula to create a table that shows the total premiums and losses for each line of business.
Table of Total Premiums and Losses by Calendar Year:

Objective: Summarize premiums and losses by calendar year.
Details:
Calculate the calendar year from the inception date.
Use the "SUMIFS" formula to create a table showing total premiums and losses for each calendar year.
Loss Ratio by Calendar Year:

Objective: Calculate and add the loss ratio to the table by calendar year.
Details:
Loss Ratio = Total Losses / Total Premiums.
Add a column to the table created in Task 3 to show the loss ratio for each calendar year.
Pivot Table for Premiums, Losses, and Loss Ratio by Calendar Year:

Objective: Create a pivot table to summarize premiums, losses, and loss ratio by calendar year.
Details: Use Excel's pivot table functionality to replicate the table from Task 4.
10th Largest Loss Value:

Objective: Find the 10th largest loss value in the dataset.
Details: Use an automatic formula (e.g., "LARGE" function) to calculate the 10th largest loss.
Data Observations:

Objective: Make observations and insights based on the data.
Details: Analyze the data and note any interesting trends, anomalies, or significant findings.

Power BI Report Test:
Using the same database, create a table in Power BI that shows the total premiums and losses by calendar year, and calculate the loss ratio in the same table.

Objective: Replicate the table from Tasks 3 and 4 using Power BI.
Details:
Import the data into Power BI.
Create a table visualization that summarizes total premiums, total losses, and the loss ratio by calendar year.
Instructions for Completion:
Data Extraction and Analysis:

Extract relevant data using formulas like "vlookup" and "SUMIFS."
Ensure calculations for calendar years and loss ratios are accurate.
Table Creation:

Use Excel formulas to create tables for premiums and losses by line of business and calendar year.
Implement pivot tables for dynamic data summarization.
Advanced Calculations:

Use appropriate functions to find specific loss values and large loss rankings.
Observations and Insights:

Conduct a thorough analysis to identify and note key observations.
Power BI Implementation:

Import data and replicate the required tables and calculations in Power BI.
